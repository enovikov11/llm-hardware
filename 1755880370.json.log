It affects the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary functions including thermoregulation. This can lead to an inability to shiver or constrict blood vessels in response to cold, making it difficult for animals to maintain their body heat.\n\n2. **Vasodilation**: Many anesthetic agents cause vasodilation, or widening of the blood vessels. This increases blood flow to the skin and extremities, promoting heat loss from the surface of the body, which can lead to a feeling of coldness.\n\n3. **Decreased Metabolic Rate**: Anesthesia typically reduces metabolic rate. A lower metabolism means less internal heat is being generated, contributing to the animal's inability to maintain its normal body temperature.\n\n4. **Environmental Factors**: Surgical environments are often kept cool to minimize infection risk and help with patient recovery. This can exacerbate feelings of coldness, especially in smaller animals or those with a large surface area relative to their volume.\n\n5. **Loss of Muscular Activity**: Shivering is a mechanism used by animals to generate heat through muscle activity. Anesthesia inhibits muscular movement, including the involuntary shivering needed for thermogenesis.\n\n6. **Hypothermia Risk**: If an animal becomes too cold during or after surgery, it can lead to hypothermia, which is dangerous and can slow down recovery processes such as wound healing and increase the risk of complications.\n\nTo mitigate these effects, veterinarians often take steps like warming the surgical area with blankets or heating devices, using warmed IV fluids, monitoring body temperature throughout the procedure, and providing a warm environment for recovery.", "images": null, "tool_calls": null}}}

Here’s an overview of how you might go about this:\n\n### Prerequisites:\n1. **Secure Boot**: Ensure that your motherboard has Secure Boot enabled with your keys.\n2. **TPM Module**: Verify that a TPM module is installed, properly configured, and active in your system's BIOS/UEFI settings.\n3. **Compatible OS**: Use an operating system that supports these features, such as certain versions of Windows (Windows 8 or later) or Linux distributions with full disk encryption support.\n\n### Steps:\n\n#### Configure Secure Boot:\n1. **Verify Keys**: Ensure the Secure Boot keys are correctly enrolled and trusted on your system.\n2. **OS Signing**: Make sure the operating system and bootloader are signed to be recognized by Secure Boot.\n\n#### TPM Setup:\n1. **Enable TPM in BIOS/UEFI**: Turn on TPM in your BIOS/UEFI settings and make sure it’s set to TPM-only or TPM+PTT (if applicable).\n2. **TPM Management Tools**: Use tools like `tpm-tools` for Linux or the Windows Management Console (`tpm.msc`) to initialize and manage the TPM.\n\n#### Configure Full Disk Encryption:\n1. **Windows: BitLocker**:\n   - Enable BitLocker encryption on your partitions.\n   - During setup, choose “TPM and PIN” for protection. This will require a user-defined PIN at boot along with TPM verification to unlock the drive.\n   - Ensure that \"Startup repair\" is enabled in case of issues during the startup process.\n\n2. **Linux: LUKS + TPM**:\n   - Use `cryptsetup` to configure LUKS encryption on your partitions.\n   - Utilize a TPM-based approach by leveraging tools such as `tpm2-abrmd` and `tpm2-tools`.\n   - Implement a method for key retrieval from the TPM, possibly using `tpm2_pcrread` or `tss2_esys` to securely bind the disk encryption key.\n   - Configure your initramfs to use these tools at boot time. Edit `/etc/crypttab` and `/etc/default/grub` accordingly.\n\n#### Verify Boot State:\n1. **Secure Boot and TPM Verification**: Both should verify each other’s state during the boot process, ensuring that only trusted software is executed.\n2. **TPM Attestation**: Use the TPM to store measurements of firmware and boot software components. On startup, these measurements can be verified against a known good baseline.\n\n#### Automate Decryption:\n1. Ensure that your bootloader (like GRUB or Windows Boot Manager) has been configured to work with the encryption setup.\n2. For Linux, make sure your initramfs is properly configured to unlock the LUKS partition automatically during boot.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Backup Keys**: Keep backups of your recovery keys for both BitLocker and LUKS in case you lose access to your TPM or PINs.\n- **Firmware Updates**: Ensure that firmware updates do not disrupt Secure Boot or TPM functionality. Verify compatibility before applying updates.\n- **Testing**: Test the boot process after configuration changes to ensure that the system boots correctly with automatic decryption.\n\nBy following these steps, your system should be able to use the TPM to verify the boot state and automatically decrypt partitions during startup on a Secure Boot-enabled setup.", "images": null, "tool_calls": null}}}

Here are some steps and considerations to address these problems:\n\n### 1. **Permissions and Access Control**\n\n- **Root Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access `/dev/disk5`. Running UTM as root can help, but macOS has strict security controls that might still prevent certain operations.\n  \n- **System Integrity Protection (SIP)**: SIP is a macOS feature designed to protect critical system files and processes. It may be preventing UTM from accessing certain resources even when run as root. Consider disabling SIP temporarily to see if it resolves the issue, but be cautious as this reduces security:\n  - Reboot into Recovery Mode (Cmd + R during startup).\n  - Open Terminal from the Utilities menu.\n  - Run `csrutil disable` and then reboot.\n\n### 2. **SPICE Server Initialization**\n\n- The error indicates a problem initializing the SPICE server, which is crucial for UTM's operation:\n  - Ensure that all necessary SPICE-related software is installed and up to date.\n  - Check any firewall or security settings that might be blocking SPICE communication.\n\n### 3. **QEMU Configuration**\n\n- **Drive Access**: Verify that `/dev/disk5` is correctly mapped and accessible. You can use `diskutil list` in Terminal to confirm the disk identifier.\n  \n- **Configuration File**: Double-check your QEMU command line for any syntax errors or incorrect paths.\n\n### 4. **UTM Configuration**\n\n- Ensure UTM is up-to-date, as newer versions might have fixes for these issues.\n- Consider resetting UTM settings or creating a new virtual machine configuration to see if the issue persists.\n\n### 5. **Logs and Debugging**\n\n- Review UTM logs in more detail to identify any additional clues about what might be going wrong.\n- Increase verbosity in QEMU logging by adding `-d` flags (e.g., `-d guest_errors,info`) to get more detailed error messages.\n\n### 6. **Alternative Approaches**\n\n- If the issue persists, consider using an alternative virtualization solution like VirtualBox or VMware Fusion, which might handle raw disk access differently.\n  \n- As a last resort, you could try running UTM on another macOS device where SIP is not enforced as strictly, though this is generally not recommended due to security concerns.\n\n### 7. **Community and Support**\n\n- Check forums or support communities for UTM users, as others might have encountered similar issues.\n- Consider reaching out to UTM's support team with detailed logs and error messages.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify the root cause of the issue and find a suitable workaround or solution. Always remember to re-enable SIP after testing if it was disabled for troubleshooting purposes.", "images": null, "tool_calls": null}}}

You can inspect these in your code.\n\nHere's a basic example using Swift:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nfunc isLaunchedFromSandboxExec() -> Bool {\n    // Check for the presence of specific sandbox-related environment variables\n    let envVariables = [\"TMPDIR\", \"HOME\"]\n    \n    for variable in envVariables {\n        if ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment[variable] == nil {\n            return false\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Additional checks can be done based on your sandbox configuration\n    return true\n}\n\nif isLaunchedFromSandboxExec() {\n    print(\"The app was launched from sandbox-exec.\")\n} else {\n    print(\"The app was not launched from sandbox-exec.\")\n}\n```\n\n### Method 2: Check `sandbox` Key in `launchd`\n\nWhen using a `.app` bundle with an accompanying `sandbox` extension, you can check if the application is running within a sandbox by examining the process's launch conditions.\n\nHere’s how you might do it in Swift:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nfunc isRunningInSandbox() -> Bool {\n    guard let taskInfo = try? ProcessInfo.processInfo.copyTerminatingWithStatusAndSignalInfo() else {\n        return false\n    }\n    \n    if let label = Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier, \n       ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment[\"sandbox\"] == label {\n        return true\n    }\n    \n    // Check the parent process\n    var parentPid: pid_t = 0\n    sysctlbyname(\"proc_pgrpid\", &parentPid, nil, nil, 0)\n    let parentProcessInfo = try? Process.launchedProcess(launchPath: \"/bin/ps\", arguments: [\"-p\", \"\\(parentPid)\", \"-o\", \"args=\"]).stdoutData.waitUntilExit()\n    \n    if let data = parentProcessInfo, let string = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) {\n        return string.contains(\"sandbox-exec\")\n    }\n    \n    return false\n}\n\nif isRunningInSandbox() {\n    print(\"The app is running in a sandbox.\")\n} else {\n    print(\"The app is not running in a sandbox.\")\n}\n```\n\n### Method 3: Check for Sandbox Profile\n\nIf your application has a specific sandbox profile, you can check if that profile is being used. This involves checking the process's entitlements or using specific APIs to verify the presence of sandbox constraints.\n\n### Considerations\n\n- **Environment Variables**: The environment variables set by `sandbox-exec` might differ based on how your app is configured.\n- **Security**: Ensure that any checks you perform do not inadvertently expose sensitive information or compromise security.\n- **Compatibility**: Test these methods across different macOS versions to ensure compatibility, as system behaviors can change.\n\nBy using one of these methods, you should be able to determine if your application was launched via `sandbox-exec`.", "images": null, "tool_calls": null}}}

While macOS does offer some built-in mechanisms to achieve this level of isolation, it often requires a combination of strategies and may involve trade-offs between convenience and security.\n\n### Strategies for Isolation\n\n1. **Sandboxing:**\n   - Sandboxing is the most straightforward way to restrict an application's access to system resources and user data. macOS comes with a built-in sandboxing mechanism that you can enable by using Xcode’s `sandbox` attribute.\n   - For apps like Telegram, if it has not been officially sandboxed by the developers, you might need tools such as [App Sandbox](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/sandbox) or third-party solutions to create custom sandboxes. This restricts what files and resources an app can access.\n\n2. **System Integrity Protection (SIP):**\n   - SIP is a security feature in macOS that protects system files and processes from being modified by unauthorized users or applications, including those running with root privileges.\n   - Although not directly useful for isolating user apps like Firefox and Telegram, SIP helps prevent low-level system changes.\n\n3. **File System Permissions:**\n   - You can manually set file permissions to restrict access using macOS's built-in `chmod`, `chown`, and `chmod` commands in Terminal. This approach requires some technical knowledge but provides precise control over which apps can read or write specific files.\n   \n4. **macOS Profiles and Parental Controls:**\n   - While primarily designed for controlling user activity, macOS profiles can be used to restrict app behavior by applying configuration profiles that limit access to certain file paths or system resources.\n\n5. **Third-Party Solutions:**\n   - Consider using third-party software like [Firejail](https://firejail.github.io/) which is a security manager designed to sandbox applications, although it's more commonly used in Linux environments. Tools like these may require some setup and configuration.\n\n6. **Virtualization:**\n   - Running apps in separate virtual machines (VMs) using tools like [Parallels Desktop](https://www.parallels.com/), [VMware Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html), or [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) can provide complete isolation. This approach, however, is resource-intensive and may not be practical for all applications.\n\n7. **Separate User Accounts:**\n   - Running apps under different user accounts with separate home directories ensures that their data does not share the same file system space. This method provides a straightforward way to achieve isolation but might affect convenience due to switching between users.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n\n- **Convenience vs. Security:** Higher levels of security often come at the cost of user experience and convenience. Evaluate what level of restriction is acceptable for your use case.\n  \n- **Technical Expertise Required:** Some methods, particularly those involving custom sandboxing or file permissions, require a good understanding of macOS's underlying architecture and command-line tools.\n\n- **Maintenance Overhead:** Custom solutions may need ongoing maintenance to accommodate app updates or changes in macOS features.\n\nWhile there isn't an out-of-the-box feature in macOS that exactly matches your requirements for explicitly allowing apps with specific restrictions without any trade-offs, combining these strategies can significantly enhance the security posture of your applications.", "images": null, "tool_calls": null}}}

Here are some approaches to achieve this:\n\n### 1. **Virtual Machines (VMs)**\n   - **Parallels Desktop**: Allows running macOS apps on Windows or another macOS. Parallels offers security features to restrict app permissions.\n   - **VMware Fusion**: Similar to Parallels, it allows you to run macOS VMs with configurable resource limits and isolation.\n\n### 2. **Containerization**\n   - **Docker for Mac**: While Docker is more suited for Linux containers, it can be used to containerize certain types of applications on macOS.\n   - **MacOS-specific Solutions**: Tools like `macOS Sandbox` can provide isolated environments within a single OS instance, though they are limited compared to full VMs.\n\n### 3. **Hypervisors**\n   - **QEMU/KVM**: Although more complex and requiring a Linux host, QEMU can virtualize macOS with some effort.\n   - **VirtualBox**: Open-source option that supports macOS guest systems but may require additional configuration for optimal isolation.\n\n### 4. **Sandboxing Tools**\n   - **Firejail**: A command-line application used to partially sandbox programs on GNU/Linux by utilizing Linux namespaces and seccomp-bpf. It's not natively supported on macOS.\n   - **macOS App Sandbox**: Built into macOS, it restricts app permissions but doesn't provide full virtualization.\n\n### 5. **Security Features**\n   - Use built-in macOS security features like Gatekeeper, SIP (System Integrity Protection), and parental controls to limit application access to system resources.\n\n### Considerations\n- **Licensing and Legality**: Ensure compliance with Apple's software licensing agreements when running macOS in a virtualized environment.\n- **Performance Overhead**: Virtualization can introduce performance overhead. Hardware virtualization support (e.g., Intel VT-x or AMD-V) can mitigate this.\n- **Compatibility**: Not all macOS applications may work perfectly in a VM due to integration requirements with the underlying hardware.\n\n### Conclusion\nFor robust isolation and security, using a commercial VM solution like Parallels Desktop or VMware Fusion is often the most straightforward approach on macOS. For more advanced users, exploring hypervisors like QEMU might be worthwhile despite the complexity involved. Always consider the legal and licensing implications of running macOS in virtualized environments.", "images": null, "tool_calls": null}}}

In practice, you might see a 10x to 50x speedup on GPUs compared to high-end multi-core CPUs depending on the model size and batch.\n\n4. **Factors Influencing Speed**:\n   - **Model Size**: Larger models typically benefit more from GPU acceleration.\n   - **Batch Size**: GPUs perform better with larger batch sizes, while CPUs might be more efficient for smaller or variable-sized batches.\n   - **Optimization Techniques**: Libraries like NVIDIA’s TensorRT or OpenAI's Optimus can optimize model execution on both platforms.\n\n5. **Considerations**:\n   - Power consumption and cost are also important factors; GPUs consume more power but offer better performance per watt for LLM inference tasks.\n   - Deployment environment: In some cases, a combination of CPU and GPU might be used to balance load and costs effectively.\n\nIn conclusion, while CPUs can perform the inference task, they generally do so at a slower pace compared to GPUs when it comes to large language models. However, advancements in optimization techniques continue to narrow this gap for specific use-cases or smaller models.", "images": null, "tool_calls": null}}}

The matrix consists of rows and columns, where the intersections represent keys. When a key is pressed, it connects a specific row to a column, allowing you to detect which key was pressed.\n\nLet's go through your code step-by-step and suggest improvements or confirm its correctness:\n\n### Key Components\n\n1. **F_CPU Definition**: \n   - `#define F_CPU 8000000UL` sets the CPU frequency to 8 MHz, which is important for timing functions like `_delay_ms()`.\n\n2. **Include Headers**:\n   - `<avr/io.h>` and `<util/delay.h>` are necessary for accessing I/O registers and delay functions on AVR microcontrollers.\n\n3. **Debounce Function**:\n   - The `debounce` function ensures that a key press is stable by waiting for a specified debounce time (`DEBOUNCE_MS`) before confirming the state of a column.\n\n4. **Port Configuration**:\n   - Rows are configured as outputs (`DDRC |= (1 << PC0) | ... | (1 << PC4);`), and columns are inputs with pull-ups disabled.\n   - This setup allows you to scan each row by setting it high and reading the state of the columns.\n\n5. **Main Loop**:\n   - Iterates over each row, sets it high, and checks all columns for a pressed key.\n   - If a key is detected, it uses the `debounce` function to confirm the press.\n   - The key index is calculated using `row * 4 + col`, mapping it to the `BOARD` string.\n\n### Improvements\n\n1. **Debounce Logic**:\n   - In the `debounce` function, you should check if the column state changes after the delay. If it remains stable, confirm the press; otherwise, ignore it.\n   ```c\n   uint8_t debounce(uint8_t row, uint8_t col_mask) {\n       _delay_ms(DEBOUNCE_MS);\n       return ((PINB & col_mask) | (PIND & col_mask)) == col_mask;\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Port Reset**:\n   - After scanning a row, ensure all rows are reset to low before moving to the next one.\n   ```c\n   PORTC &= ~(1 << row);\n   ```\n\n3. **LED Toggle**:\n   - The LED toggle on PB5 is just for testing. Ensure that `PB5` is configured as an output:\n   ```c\n   DDRB |= (1 << PB5); // Set PB5 as output\n   ```\n\n4. **Code Structure**:\n   - Consider separating the configuration and main loop logic into functions for better readability.\n\n5. **Error Handling**:\n   - Add checks or logging if no key is pressed to help with debugging.\n\n### Final Code\n\nHere's a refined version of your code:\n\n```c\n#define F_CPU 8000000UL\n#include <avr/io.h>\n#include <util/delay.h>\n\n#define DEBOUNCE_MS 40\n#define BOARD \"P123T456M789BC0EOSLA\"\n\nuint8_t debounce(uint8_t row, uint8_t col_mask) {\n    _delay_ms(DEBOUNCE_MS);\n    return ((PINB & col_mask) | (PIND & col_mask)) == col_mask;\n}\n\nvoid setup() {\n    // Configure PC0-PC4 as outputs for rows\n    DDRC |= (1 << PC0) | (1 << PC1) | (1 << PC2) | (1 << PC3) | (1 << PC4);\n    \n    // Initialize rows to LOW\n    PORTC &= ~((1 << PC0) | (1 << PC1) | (1 << PC2) | (1 << PC3) | (1 << PC4));\n    \n    // Configure PB6, PB7, PD5, PD6 as inputs (Hi-Z)\n    DDRB &= ~((1 << PB6) | (1 << PB7)); // PB6 and PB7 as inputs\n    PORTB &= ~((1 << PB6) | (1 << PB7)); // No pull-up on PB6, PB7\n    \n    DDRD &= ~((1 << PD5) | (1 << PD6)); // PD5 and PD6 as inputs\n    PORTD &= ~((1 << PD5) | (1 << PD6)); // No pull-up on PD5, PD6\n    \n    // Set PB5 as output for LED toggle\n    DDRB |= (1 << PB5);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    setup();\n    \n    uint8_t column_masks[] = {(1 << PB6), (1 << PB7), (1 << PD5), (1 << PD6)};\n    \n    while (1) {\n        // Iterate over each row\n        for (uint8_t row = 0; row < 5; row++) {\n            // Set the current row HIGH and others LOW\n            PORTC = (1 << row);\n            \n            // Small delay to allow signals to stabilize\n            _delay_ms(1);\n            \n            // Read all columns for the current row\n            for (uint8_t col = 0; col < 4; col++) {\n                uint8_t col_mask = column_masks[col];\n                if ((PINB & col_mask) | (PIND & col_mask)) {\n                    // Debounce and confirm the key press\n                    if (debounce(row, col_mask)) {\n                        // Calculate the key index in the BOARD string\n                        uint8_t key_index = row * 4 + col;\n                        char key = BOARD[key_index];\n                        \n                        // Toggle an LED for testing\n                        PORTB ^= (1 << PB5);\n                        \n                        // Small delay to avoid double-detection\n                        _delay_ms(200);\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            \n            // Reset the row to LOW\n            PORTC &= ~(1 << row);\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis version includes improvements in debounce logic, port reset handling, and code organization.

Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Grant Date**: At the grant date of RSUs, there is generally no taxable event under U.S. tax law, regardless of where the employee resides.\n\n2. **Vesting Event**:\n   - When the RSUs vest, they typically become taxable in the jurisdiction where the income arises. In this case, if the employee is a resident of Serbia and working for a Serbian subsidiary, it's likely that the taxation event occurs in Serbia.\n   - The U.S. generally does not tax non-residents on RSUs unless certain conditions apply (such as having substantial presence or specific types of employment). Since you mentioned there is no tax treaty between the U.S. and Serbia, the default rule would typically mean no U.S. tax at vesting for a Serbian resident employee working in Serbia.\n\n3. **U.S. Tax Withholding**: \n   - If there were a U.S.-Serbia tax treaty (which there isn't), it might provide relief from double taxation or specify withholding requirements.\n   - In the absence of such a treaty, and given that the employee is not performing services in the United States, typically no U.S. taxes are withheld on RSUs at vesting for Serbian residents.\n\n4. **Local Taxation**:\n   - Serbia will likely consider the value of the vested RSUs as employment income, subject to Serbian taxation rules.\n   - The employee may be required to report and pay tax on this income according to Serbian tax law.\n\n5. **Sale of Shares**:\n   - Any subsequent sale of shares after the RSUs are converted into stock is usually taxed under the capital gains rules of Serbia, as it's considered part of the employee’s compensation for work performed in Serbia.\n\n6. **Compliance and Reporting**:\n   - The company should ensure compliance with both U.S. and Serbian reporting requirements.\n   - Form W-8BEN might be used by the foreign employee to certify their non-U.S. status and claim any applicable benefits or exemptions from withholding, though typically not necessary if there's no U.S. tax liability.\n\n7. **Professional Advice**:\n   - Given the complexities involved in international taxation, it is advisable for both the company and the employee to seek professional advice from a tax advisor familiar with cross-border tax issues to ensure compliance and optimal tax treatment.\n\nEach situation can have unique aspects, so specific legal or financial advice should be sought to address particular circumstances.", "images": null, "tool_calls": null}}}

The query involves multiple subqueries, joins, and a large dataset. Here are some steps to optimize it:\n\n1. **Indexing**: Ensure that there are appropriate indexes on the `tld` and `name` columns of the `domains` table. Indexes will speed up filtering (`WHERE tld != 'com'`) and joining operations.\n\n2. **Filter Early**: Apply filters as early as possible to reduce the number of rows processed in subsequent steps. This is already done with `WHERE tld != 'com'`, but make sure it's effective by using indexes.\n\n3. **Materialized Views**: If this query is run frequently, consider using materialized views for `top_multitld_noncom`, `com_domains`, and `rs_domains`. Materialized views store the result of a query physically and can be refreshed periodically.\n\n4. **Batch Processing**: If possible, process data in smaller batches instead of loading everything into memory at once. This is more applicable if you have control over how data is ingested or processed.\n\n5. **Query Rewrite**: Simplify the query structure where possible. Here’s a rewritten version:\n\n   ```sql\n   WITH noncom_domains AS (\n       SELECT name, COUNT(DISTINCT tld) AS count\n       FROM domains\n       WHERE tld != 'com'\n       GROUP BY name\n       ORDER BY count DESC\n       LIMIT 100\n   ),\n   com_counts AS (\n       SELECT name, COUNT(*) AS count\n       FROM domains\n       WHERE tld = 'com'\n       GROUP BY name\n   ),\n   rs_counts AS (\n       SELECT name, COUNT(*) AS count\n       FROM domains\n       WHERE tld = 'rs'\n       GROUP BY name\n   )\n   SELECT \n       nd.name,\n       nd.count + COALESCE(cc.count, 0) AS total_count,\n       COALESCE(rc.count, 0) AS rs_count\n   FROM noncom_domains nd\n   LEFT JOIN com_counts cc ON nd.name = cc.name\n   LEFT JOIN rs_counts rc ON nd.name = rc.name\n   ORDER BY total_count DESC\n   LIMIT 100;\n   ```\n\n6. **Analyze and Vacuum**: Regularly analyze and vacuum your database (for PostgreSQL) to keep statistics up-to-date, which helps the query planner make better decisions.\n\n7. **Resource Allocation**: If you have control over the database server, ensure it has enough memory allocated for caching data and indexes.\n\n8. **Parallel Execution**: Depending on your database system, enabling parallel query execution can significantly improve performance by utilizing multiple CPU cores.\n\n9. **Use Temporary Tables**: For very large datasets, consider using temporary tables to store intermediate results. This can help manage memory usage more effectively.\n\n10. **Database Configuration**: Tune your database configuration settings related to memory and cache sizes based on the workload and available resources.\n\nBy applying these strategies, you should be able to optimize the query for better performance and reduced memory usage.", "images": null, "tool_calls": null}}}

However, in your table definition, the `name` column is of type `String`, and `intHash32` cannot directly operate on strings.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to convert the string to a numeric representation before using it with `intHash32`. One common approach is to use the `crc32` function, which can hash strings into 32-bit integers. Here's how you can modify your table definition:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE domains\n(\n    `name` String,\n    `tld` String\n)\nENGINE = MergeTree\nPARTITION BY (tld, crc32(name))\nORDER BY (tld, name)\nSETTINGS index_granularity = 8192;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **crc32**: This function computes a CRC32 hash of the input string and returns a 32-bit integer. It's suitable for use in `PARTITION BY` clauses where you need to hash strings.\n- **ORDER BY (tld, name)**: The order by clause remains unchanged since it still needs to sort by the actual domain names.\n\nThis change should resolve the exception you're encountering and allow your table to be created successfully.", "images": null, "tool_calls": null}}}
